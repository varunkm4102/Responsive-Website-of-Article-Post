            <p class="font2">Character encodings are representations of textual data. A given 
            character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection
             of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple 
             character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped 
             according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there
              are single-byte encodings, multibyte (also called wide) encodings, and variable-width
               (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte,
                the best-known example of which is ASCII. ASCII remains in use today, for example in HTTP
                 headers. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 
                 characters. Scripts that require large character sets such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean
                  must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, 
                  meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters
                   used the same number of bytes ("word length"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup
                    table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These 
                    use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets 
                    while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining 
                    backward compatibility properties. This group includes UTF-8, an encoding of the Unicode 
                    character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.
